Allows you to change the Terms & Conditions text for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

WooCommerce has been a fantastic option for any beginner or advanced user to establish a good e-commerce base. What makes WooCommerce efficient is the community that builds and extends the functionality of it.

However, this is a minute but important piece of text that users might want to change, but WooCommerce doesn't allow that by default.

Changing the Terms & Conditions text in WooCommerce is not straightforward as there is some code involved. Use this plugin to instantly change the text without going through any code.

== Installation ==

Installation is similar to any other plugin that you would install.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/woo-terms-text` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Dashboard->Settings->Woo Terms Text screen to configure the plugin
